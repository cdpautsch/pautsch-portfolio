This is part of a group project I took part in for IS 448, which focused on web scripts and programming languages. The goal of the project was to create an application which could serve a viable need in the student community. Our idea was a platform to help facilitate organization of study groups for various classes.

I have uploaded only the components for which I was primarily responsible. As such, and because much of the project was completed in PHP (and so requires a webserver to display properly), it will not display properly on its own. Large portions of the overall website design are absent, as they were completed by others, and I do not want to take credit for their hard work.
